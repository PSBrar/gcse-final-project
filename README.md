# gcse-final-project

This is my final year project for my Computer Science GCSE at High School. 

The core idea here is for a car maintenance planner, stemming from my interests in cars and maintenance apps that I have used before. Users can input their service schedules and recieve reminders as well as visual graphs for the data they enter. 

Uses Python, Tkinter and SQLite.
